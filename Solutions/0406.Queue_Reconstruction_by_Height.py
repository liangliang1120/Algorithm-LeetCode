You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).

 

Example 1:

Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
Example 2:

Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= people.length <= 2000
0 <= hi <= 106
0 <= ki < people.length
It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

"""
Greedy: Since short people will not disturb/affect the relative order of taller people so we can start from tallest guy(s).
We first sort the list people, in the order of descending height. 
If multiple people are of the same height, sort them in ascending order of the number of people in front of them. 
Then for each person [i,j], we insert it into res based on j. This is inserting it into j can garantee j is the right
pos for i, and at the same time, does not disturb the relative order of previous peope, cuz previous people are taller.
We illustrate the above procedure with people_sorted, as i goes from 0 to 5, the empty list res changes as follows:
[[7,0]] (insert [7,0] at index 0)
[[7,0],[7,1]] (insert [7,1] at index 1)
[[7,0],[6,1],[7,1]] (insert [6,1] at index 1)
[[5,0],[7,0],[6,1],[7,1]] (insert [5,0] at index 0)
[[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[7,1]] (insert [5,2] at index 2)
[[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] (insert [4,4] at index 4)
