"""
Given a string s. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.

Return the minimum number of steps to make s palindrome.

A Palindrome String is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "zzazz"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already palindrome we don't need any insertions.
Example 2:

Input: s = "mbadm"
Output: 2
Explanation: String can be "mbdadbm" or "mdbabdm".
Example 3:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 5
Explanation: Inserting 5 characters the string becomes "leetcodocteel".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.
